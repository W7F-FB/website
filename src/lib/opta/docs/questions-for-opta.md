## Goal Events for Goalkeepers

In the F24 feed, goalkeepers are showing goal events (type_id 16) in their player events. These appear to be goals they allowed rather than goals they scored. 

- Is this expected behavior in the data?
- How should we distinguish between goals scored by a player vs goals allowed by a goalkeeper?
- Should we be filtering these out based on position, or is there a qualifier or other field that indicates whether a goal was scored by or allowed by the player?
